# SQL-Project-Sales-Analysis

This project implemented exploratory data analysis and advanced data analysis on a set of sales data obtained from a tutorial on YouTube. The project is implemented using Microsoft SQL server, which uses the T-SQL extension.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
1. Database Exploration: explore all objects, columns in the database as well as columns of a specified table.
2. Dimensions Exploration: identify the unique values in each dimension to gain a preliminary understanding of how data might be grouped or segmented.
3. Date Exploration: identify the boundaries of date dimensions to understand the scope of data and timespan.
4. Measures Exploration: use simple queries to calculate key metrics of the business to get high level insights.
5. Magnitude Analysis: compare measure values by categories to understand the importance of different categories. For example, total sales by country and total sales by product category.
6. Ranking Analysis: rank categories by aggregated measures. For example, top 5 products by sales performance.

## Advanced Data Analysis
1. Change-over-time analysis: analyze how a measure evolves over time to keep track of the trends and identify seasonality in the data.
2. Cumulative analysis: aggregate the data progressively over time to understand how the business is growing. (running total, moving average, etc.)
3. Performance Analysis: compare the current value to a target value to measure performance of business.
4. Proportional analysis: analyze how an individual part is performing compared to the overall to understand which category has the greatest impact on the business.
5. Data segmentation: group the data based on defined ranges. For example, total products by sales range.
